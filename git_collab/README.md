# Collaboration with git 



## Working together

- git supports collaboration
- It is a tool not a method
- Need to think about collaboration method


## Questions to ask


- Where to host remote repos (one or many)?
- Who has control over the remote (one or many)?
- How will you decide and allocate tasks
- How will you know if the tasks are complete?
- (How) will you make a release?



## Who has control?

Options include:

1. One person approves changes, others make pull requests (fork?)
2. One person owns the repository, others are collaborators
3. Collaborators form an organization for multiple projects


## Task planning

Outside of scope of version control. Options include:

1. spreadsheet
2. github issues
3. dedicated bug tracking tool e.g. bugzilla
4. development 'board' e.g. trello


## Is it any good (complete?)

- Code review
- Automated test e.g. html validator
- Git log


## Making a release


- Push to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Branching: main and develop
- Feature branching
- E.g. [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
- Release vs continuous delivery/deployment

## Why are we doing this?

See [Comparing Computing Professionals’ Perceptions of Importance of Skills and Knowledge on the Job and Coverage in Undergraduate Experiences](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3218430) (institution sign-in)


They noted, for example, that “software craftsmanship and clean code,” “emphasis on coding style and commenting,” and “software maintenance” were not sufficiently stressed within their own undergraduate experiences


One participant recommended "Working on a large code base and making changes/additions to it. Reviewing changes other people are making to the codebase. Testing. Finding and fixing bugs. Using source control software, etc. This way students are actually prepared for developing in the real world upon graduating and have an appreciation for best practices, comments, reviews, developer testing, and so on."


Such projects should be incorporated into early stages of the curriculum "From the get-go people would learn the development environment. Essential tools like git, svn, in unix, and learn some of the history. Then learn languages, design patterns, team interaction, the roles in an agile team, etc
